# LocaliSense

**Making Generative AI Truly Local and Useful**

LocaliSense is an AI-powered localization layer that transforms generic AI summaries into culturally relevant, linguistically accurate, and civically grounded content. It adapts tone, analogies, and semantics based on a user’s **region**, **language**, and **education level** — going far beyond simple translation.

---

## 🧠 Why LocaliSense?

Generative AI often produces summaries that are:

- Too Western or urban-centric
- Unintelligible for users in developing or multilingual regions
- Lacking civic, educational, or cultural relevance

**LocaliSense bridges this gap** by using cognitive localization techniques, civic data injection, and regional analogies to help AI output actually *land* with the audience it’s meant to serve.
